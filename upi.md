What are Prepaid Payment InstrumentsPrePaid Payment Instruments (PPI) on UPI (PPIs)?

Users have to pre-load the wallet with desired amount. The amount can be loaded / reloaded against cash or by debit to bank account, or using credit, debit cards, UPI, or other approved payment methods in India. PPIs can only be used in Indian rupees.
PPIs can be in the form of mobile wallets, physical smart cards, secure tokens, vouchers, or any other method that allows access to prepaid funds. For additional information, please refer the Reserve Bank of India - Master Directions (rbi.org.in)

What does Prepaid Payment Instruments interoperability mean?
Previously, to use a PPI (Prepaid Payment Instrument) at any merchant, it was necessary that the merchant was engaged directly by the specific PPI Issuer (specific network). All PPIs with which the merchant did not have direct tie-up would get rejected.
The most prevalent form of the PPI used in the country is the mobile wallet. This restriction meant that the customer of any specific mobile wallet has to spend the money in the wallet only at the merchant locations that are directly tied up with the same PPI issuer (wallet provider). For example, if you had a Paytm or Mobikwik wallet, you could only use it at merchants that accepted Paytm or Mobikwik QR codes.
To overcome this limitation of PPIs, RBI mandated interoperability among different PPI issuers. Refer: https://www.rbi.org.in/Scripts/BS_ViewMasDirections.aspx?id=12156. Subsequently, PPI issuers tied-up with NPCI for issuing (a) interoperable RuPay PPI cards or (b) creating interoperable wallets on UPI rails.

What does Prepaid Payment Instruments on UPI imply?
Prepaid instruments in the form of wallets now can be linked to UPI i.e. creating interoperable wallets on UPI rails. As per extant RBI regulations, full-KYC PPIs wallets can be linked to UPI through the PPI Issuers app for making PPI payments.

How does PPI Interoperability benefit the merchants?
The merchant having any UPI QR code can now accept the payments from any PPI issuer or mobile wallet.
Similarly, the online merchants need not integrate separately with all the PPI issuers to accept their wallets on the merchant’s website.
PPI on UPI will speed up the growth of merchant transactions in rural areas and further deepen the digital financial inclusion by catering to use cases such as healthcare, transit, education, utility bills, etc.
